Cell line used for generating synthetic mixture data for testing CDSeq:

1.	AG04450: normal fetal lung fibroblast 
2.	GM12878: normal B-lymphocyte, lymphoblastoid (blood)
3.	HMEC: normal mammary epithelial cells (mammary gland)
4.	HUVEC: normal umbilical vein endothelial cells (blood vessel)
5.	MCF7: breast epithelial carcinoma cell line
6.	MONOCD14: normal CD14-positive cells from human leukapheresis production 

P.S.
This cell line datasets are public available and was downloaded from CSHL website and/or USCS genome browser. it is too big to upload on github. You should be able to find the datasets use the above data acession code (i.e. AG04450 and others). Let me know if you have trouble finding them. I will find a way to share the data.
