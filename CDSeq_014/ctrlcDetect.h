 * ctrlcCheckPoint(): function to check whether the user has pressed
 * Ctrl+C, and if so, terminate execution returning an error message
 * with a hyperlink to the offending function's help, and a hyperlink
 * to the line in the source code file this function was called from
 *
 * It is implemented as a C++ macro to check for the CTRL+C flag, and
 * a call to function ctrlcErrMsgTxt() inside, to throw the error. The
 * reason is that if ctrlcCheckPoint() were a function instead of a
 * macro, this would introduce a function call at every iteration of
 * the loop, which is very expensive. But then we don't want to put
 * the whole error message part inside a macro, it's bug-prone and bad
 * programming practice. And once the CTRL+C has been detected,
 * whether the error message is generated a bit faster or not is not
 * important.
 *
 * In practice, to use this function put a call like this e.g. inside
 * loops that may take for a very long time:
 *
 *    // exit if user pressed Ctrl+C
 *    ctrlcCheckPoint(__FILE__, __LINE__);
 *
 * sourceFile: full path and name of the C++ file that calls this
 *             function. This should usually be the preprocessor
 *             directive __FILE__
 *
 * lineNumber: line number where this function is called from. This
 *             should usually be the preprocessor directive __LINE__
